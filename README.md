Certainly! Calculating the roof area for a building, excluding windows and chimneys, can be done using various methods. Here are some approaches:

1. **Online Roofing Calculators**:
   - There are online tools like the [Roofing Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/roofing-calculator.html) that estimate the roof area based on the house's base area and roof pitch. These calculators take into account the shape of the roof and provide an estimation of the total area[1].
   - The **House Base Area** represents the land area covered by the house. For complex roof shapes, you can use an **Area Calculator** to estimate it.
   - The **Roof Pitch** (vertical rise divided by horizontal run) affects the actual roof area. Depending on the pitch, a correction factor is applied to determine the accurate roof area for material calculations[1].

2. **Manual Measurement and Calculation**:
   - If you prefer a more hands-on approach, you can measure the dimensions and areas of each part of the roof (excluding windows and chimneys) using photography or drawings.
   - Break down the roof into simpler shapes (rectangles, triangles, etc.) and calculate their individual areas.
   - Sum up the areas of these simple shapes to get the total roof area.

3. **AR Applications**:
   - While there isn't a specific AR app I can recommend for this purpose, you could explore existing AR apps related to construction and architecture.
   - Look for apps that allow you to overlay measurements on real-world images. Some apps might have features for calculating roof areas based on photographs.

Remember that accuracy is crucial, especially for complex roof shapes. Consider professional assistance or consult with an architect or roofing specialist to ensure precise measurements for your specific building. üè†üìè
